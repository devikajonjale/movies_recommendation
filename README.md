# Movies Recommendation Model
**The aim of this model is to recommend movies you might enjoy based on your past viewing history and the preferences of similar users, the characteristics of movies you've liked, and the content attributes of the movies themselves.** This movie recommendation system is built using a combination of three approaches: 
- User-based Collaborative Filtering
- Item-based Collaborative Filtering
- Content-based Filtering.

An easy explantion of the flow of the model would be as follows:

1] Data Preprocessing:This leverages the dataset containing user information (viewing history, ratings), movie information (genres, directors, actors, etc.), and user-movie interactions (ratings, watch history). Performs exploratory data analysis.

2] Recommendation Techniques:
- **User-based Collaborative Filtering:** This method identifies users with similar viewing habits to you based on their ratings or watch history.
The system then recommends movies those similar users have enjoyed but you haven't seen yet.

- **Item-based Collaborative Filtering:** This method analyzes viewing patterns to identify movies with characteristics similar to those the user has rated highly.
These similar movies are then recommended to the user, exploring related genres, directors, or actors.

- **Content-based Filtering:** This method analyzes movie attributes like genre, director, cast, and plot descriptions.
Based on the movies you've enjoyed, the system recommends movies with similar content attributes, potentially introducing the user to new genres you might like.

3] Recommendation Generation: Each recommendation technique generates a list of potential movies.

**Thus, this model presents a personalized movie recommendation list for the user, offering a variety one can explore based on their past viewing habits and potential interests. This can help overcome decision fatigue and discover new movies the user might enjoy.**
